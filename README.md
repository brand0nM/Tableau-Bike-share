## Summary 
In general, bikes are rented for shorter trips to and from work, and the vast majority of these users are subscribers. Bikes rented on the weekend appear to be for social purposes, since their usage peaks at lunch and is non-existant at 7am/5pm- customer usage peaking on the weekend also confirms this fact. Hence, customers use bikes for fun in their time off while subscribers use bikes as their primary means of transportation. Additionally, while the default birth year is 1969- which skewed the age demographic- the average user is between 30-50 years old. Finally, more unknown users are customers than subscribers, indicating there are less non-binary users and more who simply declined to answer- or went with the default gender, unknown.
