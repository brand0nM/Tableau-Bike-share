# Tableau-Bike-share
## Overview 
A New York bikeshare has hired us to interpret their user data.

### Purpose
Use python to clean the data, then vizualize its results in Tableau.

## Summary 
In general, bikes are rented for shorter trips to and from work, and the vast majority of these users are subscribers living in Manhattan. Bikes rented on the weekend are usually for social purposes, since the usage peaks mid-day and is non-existant at 7am/5pm. Hence, customers use bikes for fun in their time off while subscribers use bikes as their primary means of transportation. Additionally, while the default birth year is 1969- which skewed the age demographic- the average user is between 30-50 years old. Finally, more unknown users are customers than subscribers, indicating there are less non-binary users and more who simply declined to answer- or went with the default gender, unknown.

### Further Improvements 
Another visual could filter by bike_id and plot a vector map of each bike_idâ€™s rides. This would be helpful in determining how the most popular bikes are used. Similarly we could filter by user type and station to see which stations are more popular amongst customers.
